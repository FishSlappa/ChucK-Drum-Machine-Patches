# ChucK-Drum-Machine-Patches
A combination of individual hits and sequenced patterns. All patches here are written in ChucK 1.4 and never refer to external sound files. Some are specific imitations of extant hardware and will be indicated as such, others (particularly super simple ones) are just random ideas not intended to sound like anything else.

Please feel free to take and use any of these patches in any projects, the whole idea of having them up here is to make hardware more accessible and free :)
Tips are also welcome, I really don't know that much about electrical engineering or programming so it's quite possible I've misunderstood schematics or written in an unintuitive way.
I do also realise that ChucK is an obscure language that hasn't been updated in forever but it's the best thing out there for writing 'machine language'-style synthesis imo

Hope these are useful or at least a mildly diverting curiosity :) - Fish Slappa
